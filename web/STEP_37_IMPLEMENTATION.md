## Usage Examples

### Data Grid
```tsx
<DataGrid
  data={touristData}
  columns={columns}
  emergencyMode={emergencyActive}
  onExport={handleExport}
  onRowSelect={handleSelection}
/>
```

### Advanced Search
```tsx
<AdvancedSearch
  searchFields={searchFields}
  onSearch={handleSearch}
  onFiltersChange={handleFilters}
  emergencyMode={emergencyActive}
/>
```

### Animations
```tsx
<FadeIn direction="up" delay={0.2}>
  <EmergencyAlert />
</FadeIn>

<FadeInStagger staggerDelay={0.1}>
  {alerts.map(alert => <AlertCard key={alert.id} />)}
</FadeInStagger>
```

### Emergency Toggle
```tsx
<EmergencyModeToggle
  onModeChange={setEmergencyMode}
  autoDetectEmergency={true}
  showStatus={true}
/>
```
